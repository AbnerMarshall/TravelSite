# TravelSite Image Viewer

## Description
TravelSite is an image viewer that displays a series of high-quality travel images provided by various photographers on UNSPLASH.com. The site cycles through these images every few seconds, creating a dynamic visual experience for users.

## How to use?
Once the site is loaded, the images will automatically begin to cycle. Each image will be displayed for a few seconds before moving onto the next. The image is accompanied by a caption crediting the photographer and stating the source of the image.

## HTML Structure
The HTML consists of a `grid-container` class that encapsulates the whole application structure. Within this, there are three main components:
- `header` for the logo and site name.
- `div` with id `griditem2` for image viewing area.
- `footer` for contact information.

The site uses the Quicksand font, which is loaded from Google Fonts.

## JavaScript
The JavaScript file `changer2.js` is responsible for the dynamic changing of images on the website. It preloads the images into memory for a smoother transition and cycles through the images, changing the background image every few seconds.

## Styles
The styles are located in `style/style.css` and they provide the look and feel for the TravelSite image viewer.
